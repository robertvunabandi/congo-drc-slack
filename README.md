# Congo DRC Slack App

This app is built with the purpose of facilitating communication in the Team-DRC slack app. Essentially, some commands are built to help the team with various things.

## Existing Commands

You can already run the following commands within the Slack application. 

- `/set_expertise`: set the fields you are an expert on.
- `/my_expertise`: see the fields you are an experts on.
- `/team_experts`: see who is an expert in what in the team.
- `/guideline`: see guideline for setting up your expertise fields.
- `/command_summary`: see a summary of all the commands that you can run.

## In the Future

In this section, we have all the things that we plan on adding in the future. 

#### Fields By Number

Seeing who is on what field grouped by field. 

#### Generating Field Spreadsheet

Generate a spreadsheet of the fields with Google Sheets.

#### What's in Your Mind?

Let us know what you think we can add in the Slack channel!
